# Final_Project
- Since this Covid_19 beakout becoame True, people all over the world started asking how far this pandamic will go.
- people are asking questions such as: how many people are expected to get the Virus?
how many are going to recover?
and how many are expected to die?
- there are an official statistics and predictions 
- some of this predictions are very close to the real numbers but there are still some new waves of the virus hitting 
some states in the USA.
- our Analysis is about using histroric datasets to predict a numbers of death by COVID_19.
- We used data from "  ", the data is cleaned using Excel and pandas.
- we used machine learning and trained our data then used Linear Regission model.
- the Model's accuaray is high 0.94, but to make sure it is functioning right we introduced three more model to compare between them.
- the models we used are ; LASSO, RIDGE and ElasticNet
-the Hypothesis of the Analysis:
there is a positive relationshipship between positive casess reported and high rate of death from the Virus.
